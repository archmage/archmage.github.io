      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s going to be a brief one.
I recently replayed Transistor. I loved it the first time I played it, and 100%ed it. Coming back to it felt different, but familiar. I&amp;rsquo;d come to it off the back of a lot of intense Diablo III gameplay, and it felt like a more refined, sensible way of doing much the same gameplay actions of destroying enemies in an isometric RPG context.</description>

      <description>A quick update this time. I was doing well, and now I&amp;rsquo;m not. Between last time and now, I quit my job, went to Chicago for a month, met my long-distance girlfriend, came home and started a new job.
I&amp;rsquo;m really sad and lonely. I&amp;rsquo;ve felt myself retreating from the world in my usual ways, only this time it&amp;rsquo;s been a lot more consistent. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken steps back from friends that have been around for years, in some cases for perfectly justified reasons, and yet, endlessly subtracting just leaves you with nothing at the end.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been up in Sydney for the Easter weekend, spending time with family and friends. Throughout all of this, it&amp;rsquo;s been evident that I&amp;rsquo;ve regressed a lot since moving to Melbourne and being immersed in the struggle of existence under capitalism.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a root cause of my deterioration for a long time, but after a really helpful conversation with my girlfriend, Bri, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve finally found a way forward.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling a lot lately. Battling is really the only way I can describe it.
Work&amp;rsquo;s been hellish and cruel. Life&amp;rsquo;s been hellish and cruel. I&amp;rsquo;m really, really struggling.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dwelling a lot on the notion (and manifestations) of rejection. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple - people see someone or something that they don&amp;rsquo;t like, and they reject it. Rejection comes in a lot of forms, from overt to covert, but it&amp;rsquo;s always the same sentiment: &amp;ldquo;I do not want this.</description>

      <description>Hey. Today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write about me, like last post. Unlike last post, things aren&amp;rsquo;t great right now. It&amp;rsquo;s 12:30am the night of a work day, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a bunch, push this to the repo then go the fuck to sleep.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing pretty badly. My mental state is shot. A combination of three factors has led to this state:
 I met an online friend in meatspace, which was confronting for unrelated reasons I broke off contact with a person who has treated me poorly for a few months I started working for a client in a capacity that is extremely draining  I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about each of these individually, since that seems like a good way of healing what damage has been done.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing something different. I&amp;rsquo;ve not posted anything particularly personal on this site, and given some recent ponderings of mine, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it would be nice to rectify that.
Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this year, 2018, and what&amp;rsquo;s sort of happened to/with/about me. Buckle up, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a wild ride.
Identity Without a doubt, the most important thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me this year has been&amp;hellip; well, me!</description>
