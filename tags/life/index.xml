      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been battling a lot lately. Battling is really the only way I can describe it.
Work&amp;rsquo;s been hellish and cruel. Life&amp;rsquo;s been hellish and cruel. I&amp;rsquo;m really, really struggling.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dwelling a lot on the notion (and manifestations) of rejection. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty simple - people see someone or something that they don&amp;rsquo;t like, and they reject it. Rejection comes in a lot of forms, from overt to covert, but it&amp;rsquo;s always the same sentiment: &amp;ldquo;I do not want this.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing something different. I&amp;rsquo;ve not posted anything particularly personal on this site, and given some recent ponderings of mine, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it would be nice to rectify that.
Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this year, 2018, and what&amp;rsquo;s sort of happened to/with/about me. Buckle up, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a wild ride.
Identity Without a doubt, the most important thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me this year has been&amp;hellip; well, me!</description>
