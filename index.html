<h1>ARCHMAGE'S SITE, A LINGERING REMNANT OF AN INCORPOREAL GIRL</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! I'm Kara "Archmage" Valentine.</p>
<p>Despite a notable passage of time, this site remains unloved and unpolished. I'm sorry. Life has been rough.</p>
<p>Some of the stuff I wrote here in the past isn't really an accurate reflection of me anymore, so let's try this again.</p>
<br>
<p>I'm a software engineer by day, and a gamer/musician by night. Within videogames, the fun stuff I do is <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/archmage">speedrunning</a>, <a href="http://astats.astats.nl/astats/User_Games.php?PerfectOnly=1&Hidden=1&SteamID64=76561198015994278&DisplayType=2">completion</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31503871/">reviewing</a> niche games and sometimes even <a href="http://twitch.tv/arrchmage/">streaming</a>.</p>
<p>I play a bunch of <a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/">Netrunner</a>, it's a rad game you should check out. I also play in a couple of tabletop campaigns.</p>
<p>Music-wise, I'm a Grade 8 Pianist (with the AMEB), and recently I started getting back into active practice. I listen to a bunch of electronic, chiptune, Soundclown and instrumental music.</p>
<br>
