<h1>A temporary site placeholder by Archmage</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! I'm Kara "Archmage" Valentine, and I'm currently a bit busy with work things, so I haven't been able to give this site the love it deserves. Please forgive it its basic appearance!</p>
<p>I'm a Melbourne-based software developer, currently working as a front-end iOS developer for Motorola. In my spare time I'm a solo game developer. I work mostly with Scala, and I'm a big fan of "coding for consistency". Functional programming, test-driven development, continuous integration and code coverage metrics are all things I care a bunch about.</p>
<p>Outside of software dev, I'm an infrequent composer, a classical pianist, and a frequent gamer specialising in platformers and completion.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the projects I've worked on, <a href="http://archmage.me/projects">look no further</a>.</p>
