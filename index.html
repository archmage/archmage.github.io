<h2 id="hey">Hey.</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>Kara &ldquo;Archmage&rdquo; Valentine.</strong> When I&rsquo;m not critically low on energy, I make things and play things. Unfortunately&hellip; the way things are going lately, I&rsquo;m not really in a position to do much of that.</p>

<p>So&hellip; what else is there, about me? I&rsquo;m an overthinker. I love sleep but don&rsquo;t get enough. I haven&rsquo;t routinely eaten three meals a day for quite some time now. I don&rsquo;t cook for the most part. I&rsquo;m alone a lot of the time, and while I&rsquo;ve adapted to being alone pretty well, it&rsquo;s still one hell of a thing to battle on a daily basis.</p>

<p>It was once famously said in my direction that &ldquo;Kara has strong opinions.&rdquo; I can confirm that this is true.</p>

<p>Some more positive things: I care very deeply and passionately about the things I like. I&rsquo;m one of those people that wears their heart on their sleeve, and subsequently gets hurt easily&hellip; gah, you know what? It&rsquo;s way too fucking hard to convey &ldquo;What Kara Actually Is&rdquo; in this format, so fuck it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a lot of things. I&rsquo;m a lot in general. Lately I&rsquo;ve not been a lot, but if there&rsquo;s one thing I can leave you with, it&rsquo;s that I really <em>really</em> do not see value in arbitrarily pinning my identity down in haphazard framing mechanisms. <em>Peak Kara</em> is disavowing any sort of self-categorisation, while simultaneously picking several niche avenues of external categorisation and caring <em>very deeply</em> about them. Like 2d platformer roguelikes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve probably not come anywhere near close to giving you an accurate mental representation of the being that is me, but I think this is close to the best I can do right now.</p>

<p>Sigh.</p>

<p>Career-wise, I&rsquo;m a software engineer. I&rsquo;m a problem solver first and foremost, but my general work falls under the label of &ldquo;software engineer&rdquo;, so that&rsquo;s what I call myself. Currently I&rsquo;m employed full-time as an &ldquo;Associate Programmer Analyst&rdquo; for a consultancy company, and as a &ldquo;Systems Analyst&rdquo; for a client of that company.</p>

<p>My heart lies with dev work. Hacking together a little haven in the world of technology, pushing its bounds, ever watching for the moment when a crack forms in your carefully built wall, then patching it up before your world comes crashing down&hellip; it&rsquo;s one of the most exhilirating things I&rsquo;ve ever experienced. Lots of tech pursuits bore me, or lack potential, but I feel that heartfelt dev is a truly valuable application of my energies.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve not had any energy or career opportunities for dev work though. It&rsquo;s a shame, really.</p>

<p>This is getting long and perhaps needlessly verbose, so I&rsquo;m going to stop typing now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m Archmage#6969 on Discord if you need me.</p>
