      <description>Just finished Stormblood. What an absolute time.
I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed every single moment of my time with FFXIV&amp;rsquo;s story thus far, even the more mundane parts, and Stormblood was no exception. It took the story in places I was really eager to see it go, it did a bunch of cool world-building and character development, the themes it discussed were handled with maturity and grace&amp;hellip;
Such a good expansion. Everyone says Shadowbringers is the best thus far; I&amp;rsquo;m expecting it to blow me away just as much as the whole game has already&amp;hellip; once I get to it!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m real sad about SoundCloud going kaput. It&amp;rsquo;s had its share of issues, but there was a really cool group of people that brought their wacky, quirky talents and made cool music for all of us to enjoy.
The new rules for free accounts has all but killed the scenes I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. A bunch of creators have already left.
This is hitting me hard, harder than I expected.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still alive. Not a whole lot has been happening. I&amp;rsquo;m going to visit my parents over the holiday break, in a bit less than a month.
Otherwise work has been work, and I guess everything else has been roughly normal.</description>

      <description>Zelda II&amp;rsquo;s a really good game.
It&amp;rsquo;s weird how such an underrated, janky game has resonated with me the way it has.</description>

      <description>Oof, GDScript is appallingly bad when it comes to collection manipulation. Coming from Scala, it&amp;rsquo;s like trying to perform basic operations (like mapping!!) while blindfolded and handcuffed.
How the heck does it not have mapping yet?</description>

      <description>This week has been really good. For the first time in a long while, I feel at peace, as if I can breathe and not worry about the state of things.
It goes to show that attitudes can do a lot towards enacting change (given means and ability, ofc).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been told I&amp;rsquo;m an observant person. That&amp;rsquo;s true in some ways and definitely not in others. I&amp;rsquo;m usually pretty good at spotting minor details about things. I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes, but not always, bad at observing some aspects of interpersonal interactions.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to the point with social observations that I&amp;rsquo;m able to read something, then iterate on my related assumptions and beliefs, until I arrive on what resembles a reasonable stance on things.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting how the act of sharing a thought sometimes has a way of distorting it. The act of sharing, as in the kind you do on social media, has some curious connotations.
Thinking about how a thought&amp;rsquo;s merit shifts based on its audience and exposure is super weird. Little things like a thought such as &amp;ldquo;I think a lot of this subreddit&amp;rsquo;s content is knee-jerk reactionary&amp;rdquo; takes on a completely different tone if you were to post that to the subreddit in question.</description>

      <description>Two things:
 I made a dumb Scala script that generates words based on arbitrary lists of vowels, consonants, and a chance to pick either. It&amp;rsquo;s here if you want to play with it:
https://scastie.scala-lang.org/TEE7FA3uTY25pAoKkLOrsg I found a Markov Chain library for Scala, which sounds like a stupid amount of fun. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably play with it when I have time.

      <description>Just got off the phone with my ISP. I came home to significantly slower speeds from my router. The usual debugging rituals didn&amp;rsquo;t help, and the call revealed there&amp;rsquo;s issues on the line.
I really cannot wait to move out.</description>

      <description>Feeling pretty fragile and hollow atm. Applying for apartments is tiring. My energy levels are really low, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t been sleeping well.
I&amp;rsquo;m going on a short holiday interstate to visit a friend this weekend, which should be a nice reprieve from the daily grind.

      <description>I was gonna write some words about games I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing, and some surface thoughts about how games communities vary in terms of their welcomeness / warmth. Sadly I&amp;rsquo;m a bit tired and I think both of those topics might benefit from some incubation.
In short I played Diablo III, Cultist Simulator, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse, Sword of the Stars: The Pit and some Hollow Knight. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about those more later.</description>

      <description>Fixed an issue with my micropost rename script. Now it&amp;rsquo;s working perfectly!
For readers this means very little - microposts will have slugs (URL permalinks) that match their creation date. For me, it means that I no longer have to provide a name for microposts - they get obliterated and replaced with a filename (and thus, a slug) based on their creation date.
This means I can name microposts &amp;ldquo;asdflkjasdflkjalkdsf.md&amp;rdquo; and my script will replace my garbage with a proper filename.</description>

      <description>I wrote a bash script that automatically renames micropost files according to their date of creation. This is an unfortunate necessity to allow microposts to have their URLs reflect their post time, due to Hugo enforcing a filename-to-default-URL behaviour.
I&amp;rsquo;ve hooked it up to my site deployment pipeline; to test it I&amp;rsquo;m going to set this micropost&amp;rsquo;s filename to some gibberish. If it shows up live on my site with a proper URL, the script will have worked!</description>

      <description>Helping my mother set up a RSS reader for this site. Interesting things have come to light - apparently you can&amp;rsquo;t just search my site&amp;rsquo;s name - you need to go to archmage.me/index.xml to get the feed.
This post should fire off notifications for our many apps.</description>

      <description>Last night after work, I set up a brand new Raspberry Pi and moved my Discord bot over to it.
This morning, I finally got around to writing down some &amp;ldquo;character facts&amp;rdquo; docs for a project I&amp;rsquo;m working on with a friend.
It feels good to be back in the swing of Actively Making Stuff.</description>

      <description>Today&amp;rsquo;s been really weird. Quiet. Lonely. Stifling in silence.
I feel fragile, and uncertain, and afraid. My confidence is low and I feel very much like I&amp;rsquo;m lost.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot on my mind, a lot even by my standards, and I fear its weight is slowly crushing me.</description>

      <description>Really looking forward to moving soon. Doing this commute five days a week is taking its toll.
I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to move within walking distance of work, which would help a lot with maintaining a proper sleep schedule&amp;hellip; 💤</description>

      <description>I briefly tried to get a cloned version of my site running on my phone. I got as far as to get Hugo serving my site on localhost:1313&amp;hellip; but couldn&amp;rsquo;t access it from Chrome due to Termux being in a container or something.
Forestry it is, I guess. It would&amp;rsquo;ve been nice to be able to test it locally on my phone, and potentially optimise micropost flow&amp;hellip; though I&amp;rsquo;ve just had an idea to make them more consistently named!</description>
