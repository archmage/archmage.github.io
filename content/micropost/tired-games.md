I was gonna write some words about games I've been playing, and some surface thoughts about how games communities vary in terms of their welcomeness / warmth. Sadly I'm a bit tired and I think both of those topics might benefit from some incubation.

In short I played Diablo III, Cultist Simulator, RWBY: Grimm Eclipse, Sword of the Stars: The Pit and some Hollow Knight. I'll talk about those more later.
