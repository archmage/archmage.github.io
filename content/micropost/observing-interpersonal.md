I've been told I'm an observant person. That's true in some ways and definitely not in others. I'm usually pretty good at spotting minor details about things. I'm sometimes, but not always, bad at observing some aspects of interpersonal interactions.

I've gotten to the point with social observations that I'm able to read something, then iterate on my related assumptions and beliefs, until I arrive on what resembles a reasonable stance on things. This is a good place to be.

Unfortunately this can suck when I begin with a negative hypothesis ("this person doesn't like X"), and after sufficient observation, I prove myself right (or right _enough_).
