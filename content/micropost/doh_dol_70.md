After having finished Stormblood's storyline, I've been taking a break from story stuff, and instead working on some quality of life things. Specifically I've been levelling my gathering and crafting classes!

All of my gatherers are at Lv70, and four of my eight crafters are at Lv70. I wanted to get all gatherers and crafters to 70 fairly soon, as it'll make a lot of future stuff easier when I have to start repairing or melding with higher-level gear.

I also got a cute new top for Athena! There's an album of shots [here](https://imgur.com/a/GKcp7a2), but here's a preview of one of them.
