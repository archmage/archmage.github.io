I'm real sad about SoundCloud going kaput. It's had its share of issues, but there was a really cool group of people that brought their wacky, quirky talents and made cool music for all of us to enjoy.

The new rules for free accounts has all but killed the scenes I'm talking about. A bunch of creators have already left.

This is hitting me hard, harder than I expected.
