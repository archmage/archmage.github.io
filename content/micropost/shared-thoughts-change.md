It's interesting how the act of sharing a thought sometimes has a way of distorting it. The act of _sharing_, as in the kind you do on social media, has some curious connotations.

Thinking about how a thought's merit shifts based on its audience and exposure is super weird. Little things like a thought such as "I think a lot of this subreddit's content is knee-jerk reactionary" takes on a completely different tone if you were to _post that_ to the subreddit in question.
