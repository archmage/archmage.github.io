Oh god I broke things. The first time I update this blog in months and I break all of the images, somehow. Nice one, Kara.

While I'm here, hopefully trying to fix things... this is my user profile on the Dustforce custom maps site, Atlas: [http://atlas.dustforce.com/user/archmage84](http://atlas.dustforce.com/user/archmage84 "http://atlas.dustforce.com/user/archmage84")

If by some tremendous stroke of chance you happen to be both reading this and own Dustforce, this would allow you a rare glimpse into who I was, years ago. The better parts.

If anyone does end up playing these maps in 2020 (or, heaven forbid, beyond), please let me know what you think. In the meantime... sleep, then probably fixing this at some point.
