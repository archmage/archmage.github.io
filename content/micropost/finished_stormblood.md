Just finished Stormblood. What an absolute time.

I've enjoyed every single moment of my time with FFXIV's story thus far, even the more mundane parts, and Stormblood was no exception. It took the story in places I was really eager to see it go, it did a bunch of cool world-building and character development, the themes it discussed were handled with maturity and grace...

Such a good expansion. Everyone says Shadowbringers is the best thus far; I'm expecting it to blow me away just as much as the whole game has already... once I get to it!
