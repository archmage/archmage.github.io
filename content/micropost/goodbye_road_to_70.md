My **Road to 70** buff in FFXIV just ran out. It lasts for 90 days after you join the game on a preferred server, and adds +100% experience (not doubles; that's an important distinction) to your gains for those 90 days.

This is what I've managed to accomplish in that time, strictly in terms of levelling.
