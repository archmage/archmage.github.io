I briefly tried to get a cloned version of my site running on my phone. I got as far as to get Hugo serving my site on localhost:1313... but couldn't access it from Chrome due to Termux being in a container or something. 

Forestry it is, I guess. It would've been nice to be able to test it locally on my phone, and potentially optimise micropost flow... though I've just had an idea to make them more consistently named!
