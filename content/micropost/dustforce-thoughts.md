I was in a weird whimsical mood, so I went back and reinstalled Dustforce for the first time in years. I played that game a whole ton, years back, and in that time I made a bunch of levels with the map maker.

I downloaded them all and went through each one. After having SS-ranked each one, I can't help but dwell on who I was then, who I am now, and who I will be in the distant future.

I met so many people playing Dustforce, and I have no idea where they are now. I used to be really good at it, and I still am reasonably good at it... it's odd to think how much it shaped me.
