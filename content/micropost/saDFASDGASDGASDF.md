Fixed an issue with my micropost rename script. Now it's working perfectly!

For readers this means very little - microposts will have slugs (URL permalinks) that match their creation date. For me, it means that I no longer have to provide a name for microposts - they get obliterated and replaced with a filename (and thus, a slug) based on their creation date.

This means I can name microposts "asdflkjasdflkjalkdsf.md" and my script will replace my garbage with a proper filename. Hooray for automation!
