I'm upset with you.

I don't really know why just yet, but I'm upset at how I came home from Chicago, and for me everything in life changed, but how you've stayed the same and yet _somehow_ you have been the cause of my pain. You've hurt me over these weeks and I don't understand it, not really, but I do know how I've been feeling.

I'm mad that your anxiety causes me so much pain, through hampering your emotional response range, and causing me to feel like I'm talking to a brick wall sometimes. 

I'm angry at the distance. We've both established that it is a necessity of our relationship, while you have family tying you to Chicago, and while I have an outrageously rare financial windfall with a very uncertain duration tying me to Melbourne. There are other things about both that factor in, such as your belief that Australia is at least 70% spiders, and my belief in living in the country that has no guns and real health care. But those are more _beliefs_ than they are _dependencies_, in that you cannot leave Chicago while you still desire to be in the same country as your family, and while I still desire to get ahead in this fucking rat race of an existence.

Being the only _real_ source of initiative in this relationship has been a fucking chore. Being the one to suggest things, drive things, start things... Look, I'm used to it. Nobody gives a shit about me, and for the most part that means that I need to be the one to move things along.

I didn't expect our relationship to have that same dynamic.

You explained that your anxiety gets in the way of initiating things, that it makes you irrationally scared of rejection. At this point I'm going to make a list of things about you that are valid, so that I don't tear them to shreds in this ugly upset mood I'm in.

You are not to be blamed for the following valid things:

* your anxiety
* your depression
* your intrusive thoughts
* your allegiance with your family as a reason to not leave Chicago
* your social plans (since it has come up)
* your desire to have rest days
* any differences in our emotional needs

Additionally, I don't know if I can blame you for this, but my heart's telling me to, so I'm going to listen to it briefly. **My emotional needs aren't being met.** As it stands that falls entirely within the jurisdiction of "things I want Bri to do", and given that you're not currently doing them, I want to blame you. My gut wants to blame you, I feel needs clarifying. My brain doesn't know.

To rephrase, **your actions are leaving my needs in this relationship unaddressed**, and it is because of this that I am so sad, so mad, so upset and so angry. Because this ties into that prior dynamic of "Kara's the one to initiate", and I literally cannot do anything to change this.

At the end of the day, if my needs do not align with what you're capable of, as an anxious, long-distance partner, my needs will _stay_ unmet.

And at that point I think it's time for us to say goodbye. Because it would be completely stupid and unfair to both of us as decent people to stay in a relationship that doesn't satisfy everyone's needs.

That's like calling an electrician to do your plumbing.

Logically speaking, if what I need isn't you, it's something else, and we're both doing ourselves a disservice by acting otherwise. There's no point to you dating someone who's unsatisfied by your contributions, and there's zero point in them committing to you with the awareness that they'll not be satisfied.

So, with that very clearly explained... will things change? You put that to me at one point in this discussion today. "Do you think I can change?" and "How long do I have?" were both mentioned. Again, to rewrite this in clearer terms, **does there exist a non-zero chance of us working out?** 

I don't know the answer to that question. You don't, nobody does. We cannot predict the future, all we can make are educated guesses, and my guess right now is "things are going to fucking _suck_ while they take their time getting better".

We had a really good dynamic going in Chicago. I think you're a super fun person to be around, and I'd even go as far as to say you're a really good girlfriend to be dating... in-person.

Online, you're distant, unaffectionate, selfish, absent, all in varying quantities. You absorb interactions where perhaps I'd expect a rebound or a return. I give you so much energy and you just... take it. Very little is returned.

The notion of you reciprocating all of the good I do for this relationship is almost always absent. I've noticed it tends to go a lot like this:

You'll be doing your thing. Maybe you'll mention that you've had a hard day sometimes, or that you're sad, or something's challenging you. I'll pick up on this, and be empathetic. You will never ever ever ask me to do anything nice for you, because you're just like that, so I've of course been conditioned into simply offering without any initiation for you. How convenient.

I'll do something nice for you. Maybe it's dinner, maybe it's a solution to a problem that's been bugging you. Maybe it's something I've done for you that grants you a wealth of convenience. Maybe it's headphones, or a Steam Family Sharing setup, or it's a clean room.

**In the vast majority of cases you absolutely do not reciprocate.**

And so I'm sitting here, upset, and asking myself "why do I keep doing this?" Why, why, why, do I keep giving myself to you like this, giving you all of the best parts of me, when almost without fail, the outcome is "cool, thanks" and _literally nothing else?_

What sane person would continue to perform the same act without any notable gain? It's fucking madness.

I specifically had to sit you down and tell you "hey, maybe you could be grateful every once in a while!", and _hope_ that perhaps you'd pick up on this dynamic. Maybe you'd realise, _oh shit, Kara does a whole lot for me. I don't really do much for her! Maybe I could change that._

I got a passport so I could see you. I bought plane tickets and insurance and accommodation and _sooooooo_ many little things to make that trip work out. I did so much fucking heavy lifting. Literally and figuratively.

And then I came home, and suddenly you're distant again. Basically nothing has changed. 

You treat me like a useful friend, and basically nothing more. Unfortunately the side-effect of you concealing your emotions and burying them inside is that _I have no idea that they exist._ It sure as heck feels like you don't give a shit about me as a girlfriend.

You get plenty worried when I mention how sad I am about things, but lo and behold, suddenly things go back to the _incredibly_ typical "days of silence" state, and you're thrilled out of your mind. I mention that I'm sad about this and you're apparently just totally okay with how things have been! How great for you!

I'm like a fucking science experiment, a weird creature in a zoo, for you to look at, poke and prod and use, then return to my cage when you're done with me.

You want to treat me like a friend? Fine. Friends it is.

You know what I do with friends that treat me poorly?

Nobody knows. I don't stick around long enough to find out.
