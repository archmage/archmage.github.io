This one's going to be a brief one.

I recently replayed Transistor. I loved it the first time I played it, and 100%ed it. Coming back to it felt different, but familiar. I'd come to it off the back of a lot of intense Diablo III gameplay, and it felt like a more refined, sensible way of doing much the same gameplay actions of destroying enemies in an isometric RPG context.

It's also a beautiful piece of storytelling, and the whole reason I'm writing this is because I set my phone's wallpaper to a picture of Red, the story's protagonist.

She's a powerful individual, able to sway crowds with her stunning vocal work. She's also humble, emotional and above all, _herself._ Not a single person in Cloudbank could take that away from her, despite everything that happens in Transistor.

I've set her as my phone wallpaper to remind myself that it is a very _very_ valuable thing to recognise your individuality, and never ever let it be compromised by others. To have a reason to live, to have _ikigai_ as shaped by your own beliefs, is a very powerful thing.

Such a thing warrants celebration, and at the same time, unwavering protection.

I hope that when I look back at my life once I reach its conclusion, I am able to say that I lived a life as honest as Red's.
