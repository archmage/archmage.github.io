A quick update this time. I was doing well, and now I'm not. Between last time and now, I quit my job, went to Chicago for a month, met my long-distance girlfriend, came home and started a new job.

I'm really sad and lonely. I've felt myself retreating from the world in my usual ways, only this time it's been a lot more consistent. I've taken steps back from friends that have been around for years, in some cases for perfectly justified reasons, and yet, endlessly subtracting just leaves you with nothing at the end.

I'm getting _very_ used to being alone. Perhaps it's for the best.

I've caught myself wondering if my building has roof access more than a couple of times now. Maybe I'll find out one day. 

Maybe I'll end up okay one day.
