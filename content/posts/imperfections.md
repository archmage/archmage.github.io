Here we are again. Kara writes a blog post, usually long. People read it and think about it. Maybe something of value is added.

Today's topic is _imperfection._ This one's been building for a while, and it'll likely be longer than most. Let's delve.

---

_Imperfection_ is a counter-concept to _perfection,_ which is an arbitrarily-defined, typically unattainable state of "not-wrongness". Perfection is about as close to a definion of unreality as imperfection is of reality. **The world we live in is thoroughly, truly, deeply flawed**, and I don't think I need to spend a single word more on convincing anyone of that.

Imperfection is as real as you and I. It's as real as death, sadness and futility, and as fake as a world without woes. It's a facet of life, and as such, living means coming to terms with perfection.

We all exist in, around, with imperfection. It's impossible not to. Any respite, no matter how real or permeable, is fleeting. If my matter-of-factness is bothering you, let me rephrase: 

### The world is fucked and there's nothing you can do about it.

Hits hard, right?

"If everything's burning and there's nothing to be done to save us all, what the hell is the point of doing anything?" This is a pretty reasonable (read: nihilistic) response to such a fact, and it's this nihilism that has been lurking in the peripheries of my mind throughout the majority of this year. It's a great topic because it's relatable and our responses to that question pretty much directly shape what sort of lives we seek for ourselves (including the _absence_ of such an ambition).

There's a lot I could talk about here. This is a pretty far-reaching subject. Instead of trying to cover it all, I'm going to narrow my focus and talk about the only thing I really can - my own experiences with imperfection. To do so, I'm going to talk about software, America, social media and myself.

## Software

I'm a software engineer. This has been covered. To that end, when stars align and people let me, I fight computers in exchange for money. It's a banal, harrowing field to work in - there's no shortage of discussion about [why software engineering is a fool's guess at best](https://xkcd.com/2030/).

In my experience (and keeping in mind that pretty much everything I talk about here is _in my experience_ and thus is to be accompanied by at least one unit of salt), working with computers is a lot of things - I would use words such as "chaotic", "unreasonable", "exhilirating", "perplexing" and "painful". I also think this is a pretty normal reaction to the _apparently-normal_ notion that computers are, despite our best efforts, are non-deterministic. For those who are blissfully unaware of what this means, _determinism_ is the quality of something that, when given a consistent input, always reproduces the same output, within expected bounds.

For something to be _deterministic,_ that means it needs to be consistent. Computers, as mentioned above in words different to these, are _not_ consistent, despite the many many many dollars thrown at them. The only thing that's consistent about computers is that they break. On a whim. Seemingly at random. Computers breaking of their own accord is a _constant looming fact_ of working in IT, and it's a significant part of why there are so many people working in the field.

I'm sure I don't need to spell out what this has to do with imperfection. Any proximity to computers other than _really fucking far away_ will have you in contact with some "quirk" that a machine's produced for you, the user. Weird screen flickers? Mouse not working? Sudden freezes, crashes and restarts? This is _par for the course_ when it comes to computers. The _doubly_ sad bit is that everything that I make in my lifetime, that has _anything_ to do with computers, will suffer from exactly the same seemingly-causeless entropy manifestations.

So why bother? Why make anything if everything's going to break?
