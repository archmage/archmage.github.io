Hello. I'm Kara "Archmage" Valentine, and you've reached my website. Welcome!

In my career I'm a software developer, primarily focused on Scala but quite comfortable with most languages. I like building well-designed, durable and legible systems. My main career goal is to _make the world a better place_ through the power of technology.

Outside my career I'm an avid lover and player of videogames. In the past I cared a lot about achievement-completionism - as of writing I've completed 87 games according to AStats. Nowadays I'm less focused on achievements and more interested in just playing stuff I like.

I'm an overthinker, a heavy sleeper and I like a great many things. Sometimes I get sad, which I think is an okay reaction to some of the hard facts of life. I can be hard on myself, too, but ultimately I care about doing the right thing, wherever I can. I'm pretty approachable too, for the most part! 

If you'd like to get in touch, you can [join my Discord server](https://discord.gg/3aNgZ5h), or [visit my contact page](/contact).
