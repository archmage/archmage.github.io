Today I've reached a critical mass of saying "boy, I'd really love to play X... when I have time." I've found myself saying this about enough games over the last week, over and over and over, that it's become clear I need a plan of attack.

So, without further ado, here's what I'm intending to play over the next little while:

### Now (this week)

* **Slay the Spire**: Make meaningful progress towards 100%. Unsure how long this will take. No stress if 100% isn't feasible right now.
* **World of Warcraft**: Unlock Kul Tirans, then level a Kul Tiran until I get bored or hit the level cap. Then probably unsub.

### Next (1-2 weeks after)

* **Final Fantasy XIV**: Play it with friends, see if it sticks.
* Grab something from **Candidates.**

### Future

* **Final Fantasy XIV**: If I'm still enjoying it, I'll keep playing it.
* Grab some more stuff from **Candidates.**

Here's some other games that will either be placed in the schedule as time allows, or won't be eligible until something about them changes.

### Candidates

Things I'll play to fill in gaps.

* **Bleed**: Incredibly hard, will take a lot of practice.
* **Odallus: The Dark Call**: Not fun, but theoretically doable.
* **Batman: Arkham Asylum**: Heard it's good.
* **Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed**: It'd be good to have this done. Probably not feasible, some achievements are hard, but progress is progress.
* **Coin Crypt**: Game's fun, achievements are probably not realistic. Still, as mentioned above, progress is progress.
* **Hand of Fate**: Game's super fun. A bit hard. Would be good to have this done.
* **Borderlands 1**: I have achievement things to do for this, but I require people. This may or may not happen soon.

### Suspended

Games I'm not playing until something changes.

* **Organ Trail**: Has broken achievements.
* **Abstract Arena**: Probably has broken achievements. Difficult to tell because nobody plays it.
* **Osmos**: I need to be at least two brain sizes bigger before coming back to this.

Whew! Having a plan is good. Now to see whether I stick to it!!
