I've reached a critical mass of "boy, I'd really love to play X... when I have time." I've found myself saying this about enough games over the last week that it's become clear I need a plan of attack.

So, without further ado: here's what I'm intending to play over the next little while.

### Now

* **Slay the Spire**: Make meaningful progress towards 100%. Unsure how long this will take.
* **World of Warcraft**: Unlock Kul Tirans, then level a Kul Tiran until I get bored or hit the level cap. After that, probably stop playing.
