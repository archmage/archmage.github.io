_Session begin. 2 users present: One, Two_

\[One\] Hey.  
\[One\] Why are you living your life like it's already over?

`[Two]` idk  
`[Two]` it just feels like the places i once loved no longer appeal to me  
`[Two]` like the world's lost a bit of its charm, i guess  
`[Two]` the fact that i'd even say that scares me a lot

\[One\] There's tons out there you haven't seen.  
\[One\] Do you still want to see it?

`[Two]` i don't know anymore  
`[Two]` part of me yearns for the beauty of distant lands  
`[Two]` of houses along the beach  
`[Two]` of the gentle embrace of seaglass as light flows through it in the morning  
`[Two]` but i just don't see how i could ever pursue anything like that  
`[Two]` my dreams and aspirations are so far removed from reality  
`[Two]` even the notion of pursuing them feels like a sick joke

\[One\] You don't know what the future holds for you.  
\[One\] There's a chance you'll change, and grow, and attain those things you want now.  
\[One\] If you give up now, there isn't a chance.  
\[One\] If you hold out, have hope, you're at least on your way.  
\[One\] Maybe you won't get there. Maybe you will. Surely it'd be worth it to see what happens?

`[Two]` maybe  
`[Two]` i think you reasoning is faulty here  
`[Two]` the difference between one percent and zero percent is small  
`[Two]` one's impossible, but both are extremely unlikely  
`[Two]` i don't want to live a life that amounts to placing hopes on a one percent chance

\[One\] You might find other things to enjoy along the way.  
\[One\] Even if this particular thing is a one percent, the trick is to have multiple things.  
\[One\] Multiple small chances add up. You might find lots of things to care about!

`[Two]` i guess  
`[Two]` i just hate that there's no real option for me to say no to this  
`[Two]` even if i'd want it, i couldn't just stop living  
`[Two]` unfortunately  
`[Two]` so like... there's no other option. all i have is this stupid tired pursuit  
`[Two]` and i AM tired. living's hard. finding reasons to keep going is hard.  
`[Two]` i feel like a lot of people don't get that. lucky them

\[One\] It doesn't have to be hard forever.

`[Two]` people have been telling me that for a long time  
`[Two]` i think friendly advice can miss the mark a lot when it's too focused on what worked for others  
`[Two]` like, i'm not stupid  
`[Two]` i'd like to think i'm the opposite of stupid  
`[Two]` and yet i just keep running into shit that i can't overcome  
`[Two]` things that should be incredibly simple  
`[Two]` like taking care of myself or caring about my long-term survival

\[One\] Those things can be hard, like you said. Everyone has their struggles.  
\[One\] Yours are valid too, just like everyone else's.  
\[One\] Maybe yours are just... harder for you. Maybe easier for others, but not for you.  
\[One\] And that's okay, right?

`[Two]` it would be a lot more okay if it didn't mean i woke up without a purpose every morning  
`[Two]` the really stupid thing is that i've told myself i've had goals for years now  
`[Two]` but... these last few years, those words have lost just a little bit of their flame  
`[Two]` it's felt like instead of agreeing with myself, i'm trying to convince myself  
`[Two]` and the longer i've gone on like this... the less i'm buying the argument  
`[Two]` it's hard to convince yourself when you know all the ways to shut down your own arguments

\[One\] It seems like you've made up your mind about all of this.  
\[One\] Maybe that's why your "arguments" aren't being received.  
\[One\] Maybe your mind's just closed off to the thought of things being any different than how they are.

`[Two]` yeah  
`[Two]` that's a really apt way of putting it  
`[Two]` ...  
`[Two]` but i arrived here for a reason.  
`[Two]` things led me here. i didn't magically stop having hope one day, life happened to me  
`[Two]` and that's the scariest part of all of this.  
`[Two]` the fact that none of this is... anything other than "normal"  
`[Two]` nothing went "wrong", nothing is "broken"... this is just how my story goes  
`[Two]` apparently

\[One\] That's true... so far.  
\[One\] But you don't know how the story ends yet.  
\[One\] You said yourself you're powerless to close the book right now.  
\[One\] And it strikes me as a fact about you that will remain true forever.  
\[One\] So... what remains? All you can do is keep going, right?

`[Two]` ...yeah.  
`[Two]` as much as i wish i had an out, i don't  
`[Two]` the only thing left to decide on is how much i care about the rest  
`[Two]` and how much i run away

\[One\] It's not really in your nature to run, is it?

`[Two]` um, in some ways it is  
`[Two]` "discretion is the better part of valour" and all  
`[Two]` when things aren't working, and i identify it fast enough, often i'll just leave  
`[Two]` or quit or stop or whatever  
`[Two]` other times, when i'm invested or inflamed, i'll fight  
`[Two]` when i stop fighting, and i'm still dissatisfied, that's when i'll run, usually  
`[Two]` also when i get quiet

\[One\] Yeah. You talk a lot when you're happy, and you don't when you're sad.

`[Two]` again, kinda  
`[Two]` when the sads are energy-powered, there's a lot of words  
`[Two]` that's just passion i guess, nothing special about mine  
`[Two]` so like... talking-sad is one level  
`[Two]` quiet, distant sad is another  
`[Two]` i don't usually get to quiet sad  
`[Two]` but lately it's been a lot more... "around"?  
`[Two]` like the sads are a pile of blankets  
`[Two]` and the top layer is talkative sads  
`[Two]` but sometimes i see signs of quiet sads beneath that layer

\[One\] Are you worried about this?

`[Two]` yeah  
`[Two]` i guess i am  
`[Two]` but at the same time i have so little energy for caring about whether it changes  
`[Two]` maybe this is just what i am

\[One\] I think there's a lot more to you than what's happening to you lately.

`[Two]` my heart says no, but my mind says yes  
`[Two]` this is just stupid angst  
`[Two]` but also it might be persistent stupid angst  
`[Two]` hey, on a different note, do you find that music influences your mood?

\[One\] Sometimes! It does for you too?

`[Two]` yeah, it's hella strong for me  
`[Two]` the right track at the right time can hit me like a car crash  
`[Two]` totally jilting my mood or whatever  
`[Two]` but sometimes that's a good thing  
`[Two]` i can hijack how i'm feeling sometimes, amplify my emotions to get them all out  
`[Two]` or stabilise myself if that's what i need at the time

\[One\] Sounds useful. Also potentially dangerous.

`[Two]` yeah, i've always wondered if maybe the music i happen to listen to at a given time  
`[Two]` if maybe that music was predestined or something  
`[Two]` like grand fate speculations but specifically about music  
`[Two]` or like  
`[Two]` if there's some THING that chooses the music i shuffle to  
`[Two]` or even at a baser level than that, chooses the music i WANT to listen to  
`[Two]` wouldn't that be freaky? some weird alien ghost thing just hijacking my emotions

\[One\] It's interesting to think about, for sure.  
\[One\] You wouldn't know, would you?

`[Two]` no  
`[Two]` which, arguably, means it doesn't matter if there is or isn't a weird music ghost  
`[Two]` but what if there IS

\[One\] Haha, I'm sure you'd have plenty of questions for it if it did.

`[Two]` shit, yes  
`[Two]` good point  
`[Two]` like  
`[Two]` "why you gotta make me like soundclown shit"  
`[Two]` and  
`[Two]` "what is it you like about these six songs you make me listen to on repeat"

\[One\] It makes a lot more sense if you rationalise it as an unusual, external entity.  
\[One\] But, consider this - what if YOU were the weird space ghost all along?

`[Two]` whaaa??????????  
`[Two]` shit  
`[Two]` i need to  
`[Two]` go away and think about this  
`[Two]` and other things  
`[Two]` THANK U FOR LISTENING to my weird shit  
`[Two]` ur a good... friend? what are you anyway

_One has disconnected._

`[Two]` oh shit  
`[Two]` surely i wouldn't have TWO weird space ghosts possessing me  
`[Two]` ...  
`[Two]` would i

_Two has disconnected._
