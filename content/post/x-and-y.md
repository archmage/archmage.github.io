x: Hey.  
x: Why are you living your life like it's over already?  
  
y: idk  
y: it just feels like the places i once loved no longer appeal to me  
y: like the world's lost a bit of its charm, i guess  
y: the fact that i'd even say that scares me a lot  
  
x: There's tons out there you haven't seen.  
x: Do you still want to see it?  
  
y: i don't know anymore  
y: part of me yearns for the beauty of distant lands  
y: of houses along the beach  
y: of the gentle embrace of seaglass as light flows through it in the morning  
y: but i just don't see how i could ever pursue anything like that  
y: my dreams and aspirations are so far removed from reality  
y: even the notion of pursuing them feels like a sick joke  
  
x: You don't know what the future holds for you.  
x: There's a chance you'll change, and grow, and attain those things you want now.  
x: If you give up now, there isn't a chance.  
x: If you hold out, have hope, you're at least on your way.  
x: Maybe you won't get there. Maybe you will. Surely it'd be worth it to see what happens?  
  
y: maybe  
y: i think you reasoning is faulty here  
y: the difference between one percent and zero percent is small  
y: one's impossible, but both are extremely unlikely  
y: i don't want to live a life that amounts to placing hopes on a one percent chance  
  
x: You might find other things to enjoy along the way.  
x: Even if this particular thing is a one percent, the trick is to have multiple things.  
x: Multiple small chances add up. You might find lots of things to care about!  
  
y: i guess  
y: i just hate that there's no real option for me to say no to this  
y: even if i'd want it, i couldn't just stop living  
y: unfortunately  
y: so like... there's no other option. all i have is this stupid tired pursuit  
y: and i AM tired. living's hard. finding reasons to keep going is hard.  
y: i feel like a lot of people don't get that. lucky them  
  
x: It doesn't have to be hard forever.  
  
y: people have been telling me that for a long time  
y: i think friendly advice can miss the mark a lot when it's too focused on what worked for others  
y: like, i'm not stupid  
y: i'd like to think i'm the opposite of stupid  
y: and yet i just keep running into shit that i can't overcome  
y: things that should be incredibly simple  
y: like taking care of myself or caring about my long-term survival  
  
x: Those things can be hard, like you said. Everyone has their struggles.  
x: Yours are valid too, just like everyone else's.  
x: Maybe yours are just... harder for you. Maybe easier for others, but not for you.  
x: And that's okay, right?  
  
y: it would be a lot more okay if it didn't mean i woke up without a purpose every morning  
y: the really stupid thing is that i've told myself i've had goals for years now  
y: but... these last few years, those words have lost just a little bit of their flame  
y: it's felt like instead of agreeing with myself, i'm trying to convince myself  
y: and the longer i've gone on like this... the less i'm buying the argument  
y: it's hard to convince yourself when you know all the ways to shut down your own arguments  
  
x: It seems like you've made up your mind about all of this.  
x: Maybe that's why your "arguments" aren't being received.  
x: Maybe your mind's just closed off to the thought of things being any different than how they are.  
  
y: yeah  
y: that's a really apt way of putting it  
y: ...  
y: but i arrived here for a reason.  
y: things led me here. i didn't magically stop having hope one day, life happened to me  
y: and that's the scariest part of all of this.  
y: the fact that none of this is... anything other than "normal"  
y: nothing went "wrong", nothing is "broken"... this is just how my story goes  
y: apparently  
  
x: That's true... so far.  
x: But you don't know how the story ends yet.  
x: You said yourself you're powerless to close the book right now.  
x: And it strikes me as a fact about you that will remain true forever.  
x: So... what remains? All you can do is keep going, right?  
  
y: ...yeah.  
y: as much as i wish i had an out, i don't  
y: the only thing left to decide on is how much i care about the rest  
y: and how much i run away  
  
x: It's not really in your nature to run, is it?  
  
y: um, in some ways it is  
y: "discretion is the better part of valour" and all  
y: when things aren't working, and i identify it fast enough, often i'll just leave  
y: or quit or stop or whatever  
y: other times, when i'm invested or inflamed, i'll fight  
y: when i stop fighting, and i'm still dissatisfied, that's when i'll run, usually  
y: also when i get quiet  
  
x: Yeah. You talk a lot when you're happy, and you don't when you're sad.  
  
y: again, kinda  
y: when the sads are energy-powered, there's a lot of words  
y: that's just passion i guess, nothing special about mine  
y: so like... talking-sad is one level  
y: quiet, distant sad is another  
y: i don't usually get to quiet sad  
y: but lately it's been a lot more... "around"?  
y: like the sads are a pile of blankets  
y: and the top layer is talkative sads  
y: but sometimes i see signs of quiet sads beneath that layer  
  
x: Are you worried about this?  
  
y: yeah  
y: i guess i am  
y: but at the same time i have so little energy for caring about whether it changes  
y: maybe this is just what i am  
  
x: I think there's a lot more to you than what's happening to you lately.  
  
y: my heart says no, but my mind says yes  
y: this is just stupid angst  
y: but also it might be persistent stupid angst  
y: hey, on a different note, do you find that music influences your mood?  
  
x: Sometimes! It does for you too?  
  
y: yeah, it's hella strong for me  
y: the right track at the right time can hit me like a car crash  
y: totally jilting my mood or whatever  
y: but sometimes that's a good thing  
y: i can hijack how i'm feeling sometimes, amplify my emotions to get them all out  
y: or stabilise myself if that's what i need at the time  
  
x: Sounds useful. Also potentially dangerous.  
  
y: yeah, i've always wondered if maybe the music i happen to listen to at a given time  
y: if maybe that music was predestined or something  
y: like grand fate speculations but specifically about music  
y: or like  
y: if there's some THING that chooses the music i shuffle to  
y: or even at a baser level than that, chooses the music i WANT to listen to  
y: wouldn't that be freaky? some weird alien ghost thing just hijacking my emotions  
  
x: It's interesting to think about, for sure.  
x: You wouldn't know, would you?  
  
y: no  
y: which, arguably, means it doesn't matter if there is or isn't a weird music ghost  
y: but what if there IS  
  
x: Haha, I'm sure you'd have plenty of questions for it if it did.  
  
y: shit, yes  
y: good point  
y: like  
y: "why you gotta make me like soundclown shit"  
y: and  
y: "what is it you like about these six songs you make me listen to on repeat"  
  
x: It makes a lot more sense if you rationalise it as an unusual, external entity.  
x: But, consider this - what if YOU were the weird space ghost all along?  
  
y: whaaa??????????  
y: shit  
y: i need to  
y: go away and think about this  
y: and other things  
y: THANK U FOR LISTENING to my weird shit  
y: ur a good... friend? what are you anyway  
  
_x has disconnected._  
  
y: oh shit  
y: surely i wouldn't have TWO weird space ghosts possessing me  
y: ...  
y: would i  
  
_y has disconnected._
