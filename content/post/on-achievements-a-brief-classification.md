Today I'm going to talk about achievements. Specifically the sort you get when you contort your videogame play experience to the whims of some past developer's sleep-deprived design decisions, and watch as a cute little popup rewards your "flexibility" with arbitrary gratitude.

Achievements are a weird part of videogame culture. A lot of people don't like them, because, mildly hot take, I think _a lot of achievements are really bad._ I'm glad the bad ones exist, because they make the good ones stand out from the crowd, but I think it's very easy to see them and not look past the deluge of poorly designed achievements, writing the whole lot off as "a fad" or "a dumb modern game thing".

Both of which are a bit true in their own ways, but that's not why I'm here.

I wanted to talk about _achievement design_, from a high level, specifically the six kinds of achievements I've identified through some deliberation.
