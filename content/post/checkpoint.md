Hey all. Started writing this as a micropost but it was getting long so now it's a... macropost? No, macro means large and I need a word for "not small"... maybe just a 'post'.
<!--more-->
Anyway.

Things have been quiet lately. I've been a little busy hibernating and hiding from the world at large. It's been a long time coming, and I'm immensely fortunate that I'm able to do so.

What I mean when I say I'm hibernating is that I quit my job, I'm spending pretty much all my time at home, inside (mostly on the computer), and I'm living entirely off savings. This is why I say I'm fortunate.

Moving right along, theoretically people read these, which is, in this case, a weird disincentive from pouring my heart out, since I mostly made this site to _not_ do that! It's been a while though and again, theoretically people would like to know what's going on in my head. Now is as good a time as ever to break my Not Posting Seriously Streak.

I've been watching a lot of Smash lately. Ultimate, Melee, even a really weird variant ruleset of Melee called Rishi's Jungle Jam. It's worth looking at if you care about Smash.

I've also had some thought about whether I like or care about personally doing competitive Smash things... and I don't. The buy-in is WAY too high from a tech perspective, it's a huge commitment, and I'm not for that.

But I'm still really enjoying watching people who are, and occasionally pulling out my Switch to three-stock some L9 CPUs. I've played around with some Kirby and some Fox, but I think Samus is still my main. I can't really go past her kit, it just calls out to me, like a siren to a sailor about to make poor character main choices.

Onto probably the biggest topic I'll ever cover on this site, aside from like, capitalism.

Final Fantasy XIV.

FFXIV is a whoooooooole time. I don't even really know where to begin with this one... in that I do, and now I get to go over it in delightfully expositional detail.

I started playing it in early November. I very quickly made some friends, became what you'd probably consider "popular" if I told you friend numbers and general time spend socialising, and _completely_ threw myself at the game.

Since then... I've spent what Steam tells me is **821 HOURS** playing this game. In about two and a half months. The math on that number is pretty scary.

This, among many, many other things, is what I have to show for it.

This is my blessed bunny alter ego, Athena. She is strong and powerful and wise and she's probably one of the best things that's happened to me in a while. Through her, I can live out my ultimate fantasy of Being Good At Most Everything, while also being hot, and well-dressed, and owning a _house_.

Athena's rad. She's aiming to one day become a master of all 29 classes in the game, because, unlike SOME notable MMOs, this one actually lets you do that. For some reason (idk, ask my lizard brain), this is an _incredibly_ appealing thing to me, and thus, given a sufficient quantity of time, food, money and energy, it's going to happen.
