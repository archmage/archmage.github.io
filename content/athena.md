### Bio

**Athena Laflamme** is a Viera woman, of the Veena tribe. A **devoted academic**, she maintains an impressive library of Eorzea's greatest books. While out and adventuring, she employs considerable **arcane power** in order to protect her friends and thwart her foes.

For the most part she spends her days poring over dusty tomes, managing her ever-growing library and pursuing rare volumes to add to her collection. When she's not at home, she can be found practicing her spells, frequenting Eorzea's many social hubs or performing as one of the realm's finest practitioners of blue magic.

### Skills

Athena's main skills are a **sharp mind** and an aptitude for the **arcane**. Wielding powerful summoner magic, she approaches combat with an analytical mind and a wealth of spells at her disposal. In rare cases where she gets to exercise her skills as a blue mage, her battle style varies as much as her blue spells.

Outside of combat, she draws upon an intimate familiarity with **literature**, and a natural sort of **charisma** about her. Whether she's chasing books or chasing tail, Athena never brings anything less than her best.

### Personality

Athena possesses a fearsome work ethic, granting her both resourcefulness and focus. Despite her usual collected demeanour, she is a disarmingly kind woman at heart. Benevolent to those in need and fiercely loyal to her friends, she takes helping people very seriously. She enjoys teaching, is a good listener, and loves to hear companions speak passionately of their interests.

She has a fondness for fine attire, showing a keen interest in others' outfits and taking care when assembling her own. She is comfortable within her body, leveraging her appealing figure when both dressing and flirting. She can be quite competitive, rarely backing down from a challenge.

### Trivia

Athena has a small succubus familiar called Suki, who assists her in her duties and keeps her company. She can often be found resting on Athena's shoulder. She is playful, but shy around new people.

### OOC Stuff

I'm Archmage (she/her), Athena's creator. Thanks for reading!

Out-of-character, Athena's hoping to do everything she possibly can within Eorzea - master all the classes, collect all the collectibles, make a bunch of friends and help as many people as possible. She one day hopes to own a large house, in which to store _even more_ books.
