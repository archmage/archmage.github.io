<h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>

<p><strong>Athena Laflamme</strong> is a Viera woman, of the Veena tribe. A <strong>devoted academic</strong>, she maintains an impressive library of Eorzea&rsquo;s greatest books. While out and adventuring, she employs considerable <strong>arcane power</strong> in order to protect her friends and thwart her foes.</p>

<p>For the most part she spends her days poring over dusty tomes, managing her ever-growing library and pursuing rare volumes to add to her collection. When she&rsquo;s not at home, she can be found practicing her spells, frequenting Eorzea&rsquo;s many social hubs or performing as one of the realm&rsquo;s finest practitioners of blue magic.</p>

<h3 id="skills">Skills</h3>

<p>Athena&rsquo;s main skills are a <strong>sharp mind</strong> and an aptitude for the <strong>arcane</strong>. Wielding powerful summoner magic, she approaches combat with an analytical mind and a wealth of spells at her disposal. In rare cases where she gets to exercise her skills as a blue mage, her battle style varies as much as her blue spells.</p>

<p>Outside of combat, she draws upon an intimate familiarity with <strong>literature</strong>, and a natural sort of <strong>charisma</strong> about her. Whether she&rsquo;s chasing books or chasing <em>tail</em>, Athena never brings anything less than her best.</p>

<h3 id="personality">Personality</h3>

<p>Athena possesses a fearsome <strong>work ethic</strong>, granting her both resourcefulness and focus. Despite her usual collected demeanour, she is a disarmingly <strong>kind</strong> woman at heart. Benevolent to those in need and fiercely loyal to her friends, she takes helping people very seriously. She enjoys teaching, is a good listener, and loves to hear companions speak passionately of their interests.</p>

<p>She has a fondness for <strong>fine attire</strong>, showing a keen interest in others&rsquo; outfits and taking care when assembling her own. She is comfortable within <strong>her body</strong>, leveraging her appealing figure when both dressing and flirting. She can be quite competitive, rarely backing down from a challenge.</p>

<h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3>

<p>Athena has a small succubus <strong>familiar</strong> called Suki, who assists her in her duties and keeps her company. She can often be found resting on Athena&rsquo;s shoulder. She is playful, but shy around new people.</p>

<p>Athena lives in a small <strong>house</strong> called &ldquo;The Laflamme Arcanum&rdquo;, in the Goblet on Diabolos. It can be found in ward 6 at plot 57. Its plaque reads: &ldquo;<em>Home to a wealth of knowledge contained in a staggering number of tomes, the Laflamme Arcanum aspires to be one of Eorzea&rsquo;s grandest libraries.</em>&rdquo; She welcomes visitors and patrons alike to her humble book-haven.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>Archmage</strong> (she/her), Athena&rsquo;s creator. Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Out-of-character, Athena&rsquo;s hoping to do everything she possibly can within Eorzea - master all the classes, collect all the collectibles, make a bunch of friends and help as many people as possible. She one day hopes to own a large house, in which to store <em>even more</em> books. She&rsquo;s always looking for new friends, so don&rsquo;t be shy!</p>

<p>My Discord username is Archmage#6969, feel free to add me if you need something.</p>
