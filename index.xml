      <description>Hey. Today I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write about me, like last post. Unlike last post, things aren&amp;rsquo;t great right now. It&amp;rsquo;s 12:30am the night of a work day, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to write a bunch, push this to the repo then go the fuck to sleep.
Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing pretty badly. My mental state is shot. A combination of three factors has led to this state:
 I met an online friend in meatspace, which was confronting for unrelated reasons I broke off contact with a person who has treated me poorly for a few months I started working for a client in a capacity that is extremely draining  I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about each of these individually, since that seems like a good way of healing what damage has been done.</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone. Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be writing something different. I&amp;rsquo;ve not posted anything particularly personal on this site, and given some recent ponderings of mine, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it would be nice to rectify that.
Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about this year, 2018, and what&amp;rsquo;s sort of happened to/with/about me. Buckle up, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a wild ride.
Identity Without a doubt, the most important thing that&amp;rsquo;s happened to me this year has been&amp;hellip; well, me!</description>

      <description>Hello, everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s Kara Valentine here, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got some wisdom to share! Today I&amp;rsquo;m going to be talking about a new strategy I discovered, for coordinating zombie eviction efforts. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it&amp;rsquo;ll be of use to plenty of the folks in Malton, so be sure to share the info around with your friends! After all, folks that survive together thrive together!
-Kara Valentine
Overview The basic idea behind chain-culling is to effectively combat large hordes camping in a single building.</description>

      <description>THE VALENTINE SISTERS have been surviving as usual, though this month has been a bit harder than usual on the sisters. A number of peculiar happenings occured, too.
ASTRA and THE LOCKETTSIDE VALKYRIES vailantly defended their home base, St Alexander&amp;rsquo;s Hospital in Lockettside, from the vile and coordinated attacks of THE DEAD, but after days of overwhelming pressure, both St Alexander&amp;rsquo;s and the adjacent Tompson Mall were broken into and ransacked.</description>

      <description>After a couple of months in the deadly streets of Malton, THE VALENTINE SISTERS have settled in, and managed to survive through their compassion, skills and resourcefulness.
   The sisters and their operation areas.   ASTRA spent several weeks around YAGOTON, and found the area to be too quiet for her tastes. Stocking up on medkits and tending to the few injured survivors she came across, she struggled to utilise her skills to the fullest&amp;hellip; until a phone call from NAOMI brought news!</description>

      <title>The Valentine Sisters</title>

      <description>In MALTON, the city of endless hunger, war rages between the living and the dead. Safety is scarce, danger is abundant, and the comforts of civilisation are few and far between. Survivors stave off death by any means, while the dead surge across the suburbs in great hordes, sowing great chaos and destruction.
THE VALENTINE SISTERS are a trio of talented, passionate and persistent survivors who reside in Malton. Doomed by a terrible curse that activates if they are ever near another sister, they live out separate lives in different suburbs, though each is only a phonecall away.</description>
