      <p>Hello world! This is my first blog post on this fresh new <em>instance</em> of my site, <a href="/">Arcane Endpoint</a>. I started writing this because I needed to see how blog posts look, but while I&rsquo;m here, I may as well talk about some interesting things!</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>First, I suppose an explanation of why I&rsquo;m writing words here, rather than somewhere a bit more&hellip; normal. The long and short of it is <em>I&rsquo;m tired of how social media sites feel.</em> They&rsquo;ve grown to become this impersonal, yelling-match environment where people fight for attention, and that&rsquo;s <em>not</em> the kind of place I want to give my energy to.</p>

<p>Instead, I&rsquo;ve packed up my bags and moved to &ldquo;Kara Island&rdquo;, a place where I can breathe, think and <em>make</em> on my own terms, entirely indepenent of others&rsquo; expectations. I deserve that, and nobody&rsquo;s going to just <em>give</em> that to me, so here I am, making it for myself!</p>

<p>So, that leads into some further questions! I guess the most concice one would be &ldquo;What value does this site add to you, Kara?&rdquo; Well, I&rsquo;m glad you asked, Kara! It&rsquo;s beneficial for a few reasons. It gives me a pretty place to put my words, a place whose existence is entirely governed by me. The benefits of that alone are quite high - I can arbitrarily add new content types if that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to do. I can change appearances and structures and do all sorts of cool organisational stuff. I can delete older content on my own terms if I feel it&rsquo;s no longer befitting this site. I can <em>edit</em> stuff, and add things, and generally just grow this site like a beautiful garden of my own direction.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a really empowering thing, I think.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a cool thing to know that whenever I sit down to add content to this site, it&rsquo;s with zero expectations on that content being &ldquo;consumed&rdquo;, or &ldquo;digestible&rdquo;, or even <em>approachable</em> at all! I can write really esoteric, in-depth stuff and not care if it&rsquo;s seen or not - there&rsquo;s value to me in simply writing what&rsquo;s on my mind.</p>

<p>Another thing is that there&rsquo;s no alarmingly-large megacorporations automatically feeding my words into algorithms, to figure out how to manipulate my friends into spending more time on evil hellsites.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>The second thing I wanted to talk about is <em>microblogging</em>. Sites like Twitter and Mastodon are <em>microblogging sites</em> in that they let you post chronological updates, but instead of being longform and lengthy posts like this one, they&rsquo;re very small, very granular and act more like <em>snapshots</em> of an account&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>I really like that style of writing. There&rsquo;s a lot of wit that can emerge from shorter mediums, and there&rsquo;s no shortage of funny tweets out there. Unfortunately, I think that there&rsquo;s a lot of nuance missed in the connections between people on microblogging sites. Mastodon is a decent example of how a high character limit helps (around 500, I recall?), but does not <em>entirely</em> eliminate the loss of nuance in communication. Plus, both sites have their own &ldquo;social context weighting&rdquo; that shifts people&rsquo;s natural behaviours into a more collectively-accepted standard, and I don&rsquo;t really like that! (That&rsquo;s more of a general social media thing, but it definitely applies to microblogging sites too.) Not to mention the variable quantity of bad actors in both environments&hellip;</p>

<p>Why am I talking about microblogging, then? Because I&rsquo;ve added <a href="/micropost">my own microblog</a> to this site! It&rsquo;s a separate section that only shows microposts, which are written entirely differently. I&rsquo;m intending to use it as a more raw &ldquo;stream-of-thoughts&rdquo; sorta deal. This is a particularly exciting thing for me personally - I had a thought of allowing both regular blog posts and microposts on the one site, and through clever use of my tools, I was able to turn that into a reality.</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>The third and last thing I wanted to talk about is <em>RSS feeds.</em> These are a cool, older web technology that expose a chronologically-sorted list of a site&rsquo;s content, that you can subscribe to with an RSS reader. You can find RSS readers on practically every platform (mobile, web, desktop, whatever), they&rsquo;re quite simple from a software perspective.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m realising that that paragraph didn&rsquo;t actualy convey the concept I indended it to, so here&rsquo;s what RSS feeds actually do - <em>they let you read sites&rsquo; content like a news feed.</em> Specifically a news feed that&rsquo;s always chronologically sorted (unlike certain <em>other</em> sites), free of ads, never has suggested content&hellip; You have complete control over how you read content with RSS readers. There&rsquo;s no site buy-in, since RSS feeds are pretty much always free and public.</p>

<p>At any rate, RSS readers are pretty easy to set up and they&rsquo;re a cool way of keeping up with sites that aren&rsquo;t ingrained into your day-to-day app perusal behaviour. All this is to say, with no expectations from myself, if you&rsquo;d like to keep up to date with <em>this</em> site and you&rsquo;re not sure how to do that other than manually checking it, RSS readers might be a good solution for you.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll put some RSS buttons in and around the page, to make that process a bit easier, but you can typically search a site with modern RSS readers and they&rsquo;ll show you all of the feeds they&rsquo;ve got available. I&rsquo;d be happy to talk more about RSS readers if anyone has questions!</p>

<p>&ndash;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;ll do for now, for a first post. I have more things to talk about (I <em>always</em> do; if I don&rsquo;t, something is <em>very</em> wrong), but they can go in other posts.</p>

<p>Until next time!</p>
