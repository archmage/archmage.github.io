<p>Here we are again. Kara writes a blog post, usually long. People read it and think about it. Maybe something of value is added.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s topic is <em>imperfection.</em> This one&rsquo;s been building for a while, and it&rsquo;ll likely be longer than most. Let&rsquo;s delve.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>Imperfection</em> is a counter-concept to <em>perfection,</em> which is an arbitrarily-defined, typically unattainable state of &ldquo;not-wrongness&rdquo;. Perfection is about as close to a definion of unreality as imperfection is of reality. <strong>The world we live in is thoroughly, truly, deeply flawed</strong>, and I don&rsquo;t think I need to spend a single word more on convincing anyone of that.</p>

<p>Imperfection is as real as you and I. It&rsquo;s as real as death, sadness and futility, and as fake as a world without woes. It&rsquo;s a facet of life, and as such, living means coming to terms with perfection.</p>

<p>We all exist in, around, with imperfection. It&rsquo;s impossible not to. Any respite, no matter how real or permeable, is fleeting. If my matter-of-factness is bothering you, let me rephrase:</p>

<h3 id="the-world-is-fucked-and-there-s-nothing-you-can-do-about-it">The world is fucked and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it.</h3>

<p>Hits hard, right?</p>

<p>&ldquo;If everything&rsquo;s burning and there&rsquo;s nothing to be done to save us all, what the hell is the point of doing anything?&rdquo; This is a pretty reasonable (read: nihilistic) response to such a fact, and it&rsquo;s this nihilism that has been lurking in the peripheries of my mind throughout the majority of this year. It&rsquo;s a great topic because it&rsquo;s relatable and our responses to that question pretty much directly shape what sort of lives we seek for ourselves (including the <em>absence</em> of such an ambition).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot I could talk about here. This is a pretty far-reaching subject. Instead of trying to cover it all, I&rsquo;m going to narrow my focus and talk about the only thing I really can - my own experiences with imperfection. To do so, I&rsquo;m going to talk about software, America, social media and myself.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer. This has been covered. To that end, when stars align and people let me, I fight computers in exchange for money. It&rsquo;s a banal, harrowing field to work in - there&rsquo;s no shortage of discussion about <a href="https://xkcd.com/2030/">why software engineering is a fool&rsquo;s guess at best</a>.</p>

<p>In my experience (and keeping in mind that pretty much everything I talk about here is <em>in my experience</em> and thus is to be accompanied by at least one unit of salt), working with computers is a lot of things - I would use words such as &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo;, &ldquo;exhilirating&rdquo;, &ldquo;perplexing&rdquo; and &ldquo;painful&rdquo;. I also think this is a pretty normal reaction to the <em>apparently-normal</em> notion that computers are, despite our best efforts, are non-deterministic. For those who are blissfully unaware of what this means, <em>determinism</em> is the quality of something that, when given a consistent input, always reproduces the same output, within expected bounds.</p>

<p>For something to be <em>deterministic,</em> that means it needs to be consistent. Computers, as mentioned above in words different to these, are <em>not</em> consistent, despite the many many many dollars thrown at them. The only thing that&rsquo;s consistent about computers is that they break. On a whim. Seemingly at random. Computers breaking of their own accord is a <em>constant looming fact</em> of working in IT, and it&rsquo;s a significant part of why there are so many people working in the field.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t need to spell out what this has to do with imperfection. Any proximity to computers other than <em>really fucking far away</em> will have you in contact with some &ldquo;quirk&rdquo; that a machine&rsquo;s produced for you, the user. Weird screen flickers? Mouse not working? Sudden freezes, crashes and restarts? This is <em>par for the course</em> when it comes to computers. The <em>doubly</em> sad bit is that everything that I make in my lifetime, that has <em>anything</em> to do with computers, will suffer from exactly the same seemingly-causeless entropy manifestations.</p>

<p>So why bother? Why make anything if everything&rsquo;s going to break?</p>
