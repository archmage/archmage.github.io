<p>I&rsquo;ve been battling a lot lately. Battling is really the only way I can describe it.</p>

<p>Work&rsquo;s been hellish and cruel. Life&rsquo;s been hellish and cruel. I&rsquo;m really, really struggling.</p>

<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been dwelling a lot on the notion (and manifestations) of <strong>rejection</strong>. It&rsquo;s pretty simple - people see someone or something that they don&rsquo;t like, and they reject it. Rejection comes in a lot of forms, from overt to covert, but it&rsquo;s always the same sentiment: &ldquo;I do not want this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise to literally <em>anyone</em> that I&rsquo;ve been rejected a lot, in a lot of contexts. Enough rejection changes people. It&rsquo;s certainly changed me.</p>

<p>Past a point, rejection stops becoming a mild disappointment, a frustrating null-outcome, a teary heartfelt goodbye to things that could&rsquo;ve been, and it <em>instead</em> becomes a weight on that person&rsquo;s back. It&rsquo;s heavy, it&rsquo;s omnipresent, it&rsquo;s lighter on some days and heavier on others, but it&rsquo;s always there.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really possible to forget rejection once it accumulates far enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Let me be real with you</strong> - if you&rsquo;re reading this and I haven&rsquo;t spoken to you in a one-on-one context in the last few months (and that&rsquo;s being generous), one of these things has probably happened:</p>

<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;ve rejected me</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve rejected you</li>
<li>Neither of us were really close enough for rejection to be a factor</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Rejection happens for a ton of reasons! <strong>I might&rsquo;ve called you a bigot</strong>, and you might&rsquo;ve been upset at being called out, so you refused to talk to me. I might&rsquo;ve refused to talk to you. Either way, I&rsquo;m better off, and you&hellip; well, you&rsquo;re probably still a bigot.</p>

<p><strong>I might&rsquo;ve voiced some concerns about the company you keep</strong>, and you might&rsquo;ve taken that really badly. You might&rsquo;ve chosen a bunch of dickheads over me, because they&rsquo;re <em>your</em> dickheads, and I&rsquo;m just&hellip; me. (This one&rsquo;s happened a lot!)</p>

<p><strong>I might have reached out to you and asked for help</strong>. You might have completely and utterly failed me in your duty to provide support, whether it be as a friend or as a colleague. In that sense, your rejection only barely beat mine chronologically; I do not have time, patience or energy for such behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>I might have failed you</strong>. (This one&rsquo;s also happened a lot.) To that, I have two things to say: <strong>I&rsquo;m sorry</strong>, and I try my hardest to be better each day that passes. (To those that care to look past whatever it is about me that causes folks to reject me, I hope my efforts are visible.)</p>

<p>In other cases, rejection can be really violent, volatile, passionate. It can happen with fury, or scorn, or under the pretenses of justice. Sometimes it&rsquo;s done with the best of intentions, to protect oneself, and sometimes it&rsquo;s done with zero care about the consequences.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Rejection fucking sucks.</strong> It&rsquo;s never a good time to have to draw lines when people are invested and feelings might get hurt. (Assuming you have empathy about that sort of thing.)</p>

<p>Rejection&rsquo;s also really dangerous! People naturally seek acceptance from their peers; we&rsquo;re social creatures for the most part, and we need company to stop us from going mad. Enough rejection can set people on dark, lonely roads, that don&rsquo;t end in good places.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, rejection&rsquo;s almost always both unambiguous (see: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001508/">He&rsquo;s Just Not That Into You</a>) and persistent (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too busy, sorry!&rdquo; rarely ever becomes anything else). In a long enough life, rejection becomes a list of people who have chosen to reject. Each one&rsquo;s a sad story, and when the list gets long enough&hellip; you have a life full of sad stories.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to see why folks chase acceptance so desperately, because the alternative ranges from momentary sadness to killing yourself.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m somewhere in the middle, right now!</strong> ⭐ Hi! Hello! I&rsquo;m Kara and I&rsquo;m struggling with depression! ⭐</p>

<p>Dealing with the weight of rejection is getting to me. It&rsquo;s hard. I feel the burden of having to keep living, while so many before me have observed me and said &ldquo;nope&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If this whole concept of &ldquo;the weight of rejection&rdquo; is foreign to you? Good for you. You can stop reading now.</p>

<p>Otherwise&hellip; I hope some of this resonates with you.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>I expect a bunch of samey questions/comments to be made by folks who read this, so I&rsquo;m going to get in early and answer them to save us both the trouble.</em></p>

<p><strong>Q. You can reach out to me anytime you need support!</strong><br />
A. If we&rsquo;re not already talking, you offering a shallow &ldquo;here if you need support&rdquo; is not going to change that. Sorry to be overt in my rejection, but there&rsquo;s a reason we&rsquo;re not in communication; whether that&rsquo;s you or me is beside the point.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Have you tried-</strong><br />
I&rsquo;m not asking you for either a solution or to <em>be</em> my solution. That&rsquo;s not what this is.</p>

<p><strong>Q. You&rsquo;re kind of rough around the edges, maybe that&rsquo;s why people keep rejecting you!</strong><br />
A. You know what, yes, but there are a <em>lot</em> of people a <em>lot</em> rougher around <em>their</em> edges than I am around mine, and they&rsquo;re doing just fine.</p>

<p><strong>Q. Why not change? Be nicer, be more relatable, people will like you!</strong><br />
A. I&rsquo;m not giving up my identity to score cool points, &lt;Generic Authoritative Figure&gt;.</p>

<p><strong>Q. People have their reasons for rejecting things, you know! You should respect that!</strong><br />
A. Why do you think <em>I&rsquo;m writing about rejection?</em> If this didn&rsquo;t matter to me, would I go to this level of detail?</p>

<p><strong>Q. Geez, what do you <em>actually</em> want, Kara?</strong><br />
A. One of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to not have to sell five of my seven days in a week to a fucky corporation in exchange for the right to not starve to death.</li>
<li>Failing that, I want about half a billion dollars, so I can both do everything I want in life, and as part of that, enact a real, tangible, systematic change in the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a little more realistic&hellip; I can&rsquo;t change the world. I can&rsquo;t change people. All I can control is myself, and right now, this human is suffering from Severe Pilot Disenfranchisement. I&rsquo;m sick of existing in a world where rejection, indifference and an abundance of sadness is my reality.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want this. I didn&rsquo;t choose this. I&rsquo;m running out of reasons to keep going with this depressing facade of a &ldquo;life&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t want to keep giving my limited energy to sources of rejection; they don&rsquo;t deserve me, and I deserve better.</p>

<p>What I want, is for life to stop being as utterly <em>garbage</em> as it has lately been.</p>

<hr />

<p>To the many, many rejections that I&rsquo;ve encountered, and no doubt will continue to face&hellip;</p>
