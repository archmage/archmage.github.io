        <p>This one&rsquo;s going to be a brief one.</p>

<p>I recently replayed Transistor. I loved it the first time I played it, and 100%ed it. Coming back to it felt different, but familiar. I&rsquo;d come to it off the back of a lot of intense Diablo III gameplay, and it felt like a more refined, sensible way of doing much the same gameplay actions of destroying enemies in an isometric RPG context.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also a beautiful piece of storytelling, and the whole reason I&rsquo;m writing this is because I set my phone&rsquo;s wallpaper to a picture of Red, the story&rsquo;s protagonist.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a powerful individual, able to sway crowds with her stunning vocal work. She&rsquo;s also humble, emotional and above all, <em>herself.</em> Not a single person in Cloudbank could take that away from her, despite everything that happens in Transistor.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve set her as my phone wallpaper to remind myself that it is a very <em>very</em> valuable thing to recognise your individuality, and never ever let it be compromised by others. To have a reason to live, to have <em>ikigai</em> as shaped by your own beliefs, is a very powerful thing.</p>

<p>Such a thing warrants celebration, and at the same time, unwavering protection.</p>

<p>I hope that when I look back at my life once I reach its conclusion, I am able to say that I lived a life as honest as Red&rsquo;s.</p>
